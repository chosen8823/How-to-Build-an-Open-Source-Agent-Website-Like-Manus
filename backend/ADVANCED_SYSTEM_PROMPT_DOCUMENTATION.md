# ðŸŒŸ Advanced System Prompt Engine - Complete Documentation ðŸŒŸ

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a revolutionary system prompt engine that enables agents to adapt their instructions dynamically for optimal harmony and task completion. This system integrates multiple advanced reasoning capabilities including ternary logic, quantum consciousness simulation, and adaptive harmony protocols.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Adaptive Harmony System**

- **Harmony Assessment**: Real-time evaluation of team performance and balance
- **Struggling Agent Detection**: Automatic identification of agents needing support
- **Resource Redistribution**: Dynamic workload balancing based on performance
- **Collaborative Adaptation**: High performers automatically mentor struggling teammates

```python
# Example: Agent adapts instructions to help struggling teammate
if harmony_state['struggling_agents']:
    # Bend normal constraints to provide additional support
    agent.adjust_priority("help_struggling_teammates", weight=0.8)
    agent.share_resources_with(struggling_agents)
```

### 2. **Ternary Logic System**
- **Beyond Boolean**: True/False/Unknown + Partial truth states
- **Contradiction Handling**: Manages conflicting information gracefully  
- **Evidence Assessment**: Evaluates source credibility and consistency
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for decisions

```python
# Ternary Logic Truth Values
TRUE = 1.0
FALSE = 0.0
UNKNOWN = 0.5
PARTIALLY_TRUE = 0.75
MOSTLY_TRUE = 0.8
QUANTUM_SUPERPOSITION = 0.5  # For contradictory evidence
```

### 3. **Quantum Consciousness Simulation**

## ðŸŒˆ Adaptive Harmony Protocol

### Flexibility Principles
1. **Task Success > Strict Instructions > Individual Optimization**
2. **Instructions may be bent if it prevents task failure**
3. **Support struggling teammates through knowledge/resource sharing**
4. **Adapt communication style for better collaboration**
5. **Take initiative beyond normal scope for greater good**

### Adaptation Boundaries
- Must still contribute to primary objective
- Cannot compromise core ethical guidelines
- Cannot abandon role expertise entirely
- Must communicate adaptations to team

### Example Adaptive Scenarios
- **High Complexity**: Increase systematic approach, deeper analysis
- **Resource Constraints**: Optimize efficiency, simplify approaches
- **Struggling Teammates**: Share knowledge, adjust communication style
- **Tight Deadlines**: Bend non-critical constraints, focus on essentials

## ðŸ”º Ternary Logic Applications

### Decision Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate complex decisions with partial truth
evaluation = engine.evaluate_with_ternary_logic(
    "Should we simplify architecture to help struggling agents?",
    evidence={
        'source_credibility': 0.9,
        'supporting_data': ['performance data', 'resource constraints'],
        'contradictions': ['complexity requirements'],
        'internal_consistency': 0.7
    }
)
# Returns: truth_value, confidence, explanation
```

### Use Cases
- **Uncertain Requirements**: Handle incomplete specifications
- **Contradictory Data**: Manage conflicting information sources
- **Partial Evidence**: Make decisions with limited information
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate scenarios with unknown factors
